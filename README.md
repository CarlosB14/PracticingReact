# GPT PhD Professor for React Learning

Welcome to the GPT PhD Professor project! This project leverages the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT to create an interactive and personalized learning experience, specifically tailored for improving your React.js knowledge and skills.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes a customized version of ChatGPT, designed to act as a PhD-level professor in the field of React.js development. The primary goal is to create a dynamic and adaptive learning environment where you can:

1. **Generate Exercises**: The GPT Professor generates coding exercises based on your current skill level and learning goals. These exercises cover a range of topics within React.js, from basic concepts to advanced techniques.

2. **Evaluate Your Work**: After you complete an exercise, the GPT Professor evaluates your solution, providing feedback on correctness, efficiency, and best practices.

3. **Adjust Difficulty**: The GPT Professor asks you about the difficulty level of the exercises. Based on your feedback, it can adjust the complexity of subsequent exercises, either increasing the challenge or providing more practice at the current level.

4. **Continuous Learning**: The system encourages continuous learning and improvement by offering a series of progressively challenging exercises. You can choose to focus on specific areas of React or take a more general approach to enhance your overall proficiency.

## How It Works

1. **Starting a Session**: Begin by initiating a conversation with the GPT Professor. Specify your current knowledge level, and the professor will tailor the exercises accordingly.

2. **Completing Exercises**: The GPT Professor provides an exercise, which you solve directly in your development environment. Once completed, you submit your solution back to the professor.

3. **Receiving Feedback**: The GPT Professor reviews your submission, providing detailed feedback on what was done well and where improvements can be made.

4. **Difficulty Adjustment**: Based on the feedback you provide about the difficulty, the GPT Professor will adjust future exercises to match your desired challenge level.

5. **Ongoing Learning**: Continue the cycle of learning, practicing, and receiving feedback until you feel confident in your React.js skills.

## Features

- **Adaptive Learning**: Exercises are customized to your skill level and adjusted based on your progress.
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: Detailed evaluation of your solutions helps you understand your mistakes and learn best practices.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: You control the difficulty level, making the learning experience both challenging and rewarding.
- **Focus on React.js**: Targeted exercises ensure deep learning and understanding of key React concepts and techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply open a conversation with the GPT PhD Professor. Specify your current skill level and any areas you'd like to focus on. The professor will guide you through a series of exercises, providing feedback and adjusting difficulty as needed.

### Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of JavaScript and React.js
- A development environment set up for React (e.g., Node.js, npm/yarn, React)
